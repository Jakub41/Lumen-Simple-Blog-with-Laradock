# Lumen Laradock Simple Blog

This project was done with the intention to show to create a project using **Lumen** and **Laradock**.

**Lumen** is an open-source PHP based micro-framework created by Taylor Otwell in 2015. Lumen is designed for building lightning fast micro-services and APIs. And it opts for maximum speed rather than flexibility in the bootstrapping process. The PHP micro-framework was born out of the need to have light Laravel installations that could be faster than existing PHP micro-frameworks such as Slim and Silex.
